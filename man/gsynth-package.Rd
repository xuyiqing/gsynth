\title{Generalized Synthetic Control Method}
\description{Implements the generalized synthetic control method based on interactive fixed effect models.}
\details{
  Implements the generalized synthetic control method. It imputes
  counterfactuals for each treated unit using control group
  information based on a linear interactive fixed effects model that
  incorporates unit-specific intercepts interacted with time-varying
  coefficients.

  See \code{\link{gsynth}} for details.
